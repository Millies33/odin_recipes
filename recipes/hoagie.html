  <h2>Description:</h2>
  
  <p>These hearty roast beef hoagies with lots of bell pepper 
    and onions are topped with traditional pasta sauce and a slice of provolone cheese.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>1 jar ragu</li>
    <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 sliced bel pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Pour sauce into a small saucepan; cover and heat over low until just warm.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute olive oil with garlic, peppers, and onion until vegetables soften, about 3 to 5 minutes; 
      remove vegetables from pan. Add roast beef to skillet. Saute over medium-high heat until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      To assemble sandwiches, open each hoagie bun lengthwise and divide roast beef slices among the rolls. Top with vegetables, about 
      1/4 cup of Ragu® Old World Style® Traditional Sauce, and one slice of provolone cheese. (Heat remainder of sauce for dipping, 
      if desired.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Place hoagies on a baking sheet and bake for about 3 to 5 minutes until cheese is melted. Serve hot and enjoy!
